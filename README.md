Instructions to run the steam controller under linux.

## Basic Setup
Opting into the Steam Beta did disable the controller completely on my machine. However there are some
users that report improvements (4).

See comments in [70-steam-controller-permission.rule](./70-steam-controller-permission.rule) (1)

Tested on Manjaro 4.1.34-2

Fixed the following error for me:

    [ 751.559591] hid-generic 0003:2F00:1052.000F: usb_submit_urb(ctrl) failed: -1
    [ 751.559599] hid-generic 0003:2F00:1052.000F: timeout initializing reports
    [ 751.559722] hid-generic 0003:2F00:1052.000F: hiddev0,hidraw0: USB HID v1.11 Device [Valve Software BOOT LDR] on usb-0000:00:14.0-12.3/input0

## Steam Keyboard
In Order to get the Steam Keyboard to work make sure that the window "Steam Keyboard" is set to always on top undecorated and that it does not get the focus. (2)

- [steam-keyboard-mouse-focus.ds](./steam-keyboard-mouse-focus.ds) is a very unsatisfying fix (for awesomewm)
- [steam-keyboard.ds](./steam-keyboard.ds) is a fix for gnome

## Gamepad Emulation
Run the following command as root user (3):

    chown root:steamcontroller /dev/uinput; chmod g+rw /dev/uinput;

Put it into your */etc/rc.local* so that it will be executed on every boot.

Tested on Manjaro 4.1.34-2

An unconfirmed udev rule to archive this is (4):

    KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="steamcontroller", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput"

## What does not work?
- Gamepad and Keyboard Mouse emulation with some steam games.
- Correct mappings to Keyboards other than QWERTY
- Steam Keyboard in some window managers (especially tiled)
